      "AboutMe": "Hi! I am Xagly a Full-stack Web Developer with a passion for web development and all things creative. In addition to my web development stack, I decided to start a new journey in order to improve the user experience through research and design. Therefore, I am currently working on the Google UX Design Professional Certificate in order to create digital products that are not only enjoyable, useful and visually appealing, but also ensure an equitable user experience.  When I am not busy, I enjoy producing electronic music, experimenting with new cooking recipes, and cycling to keep fit."
