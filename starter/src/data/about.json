      "AboutMe": "As a full-stack web developer with a passion for web development and all things creative, I bring a unique blend of skills and experiences to the table. My early education in music, specializing in percussion, and with experience as a competitive Snare line player, has allowed me to develop a keen eye for detail, a strong focus on efficiency and a strong commitment to creativity and continuous growth to create personal and business websites that showcase a unique voice and values, ultimately to help establish a strong online presence.  When I am not busy, I enjoy producing electronic music, experimenting with new recipes, and cycling."
